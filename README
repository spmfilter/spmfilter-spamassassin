WHAT IS SPMFILTER-SPAMASSASSIN?
-------------------------------

spamassassin is a plugin for spmfilter that enables spmfilter to spam-check emails with the 
help of the daemonized version of Spamassassin (spamd). The major goal of this plugin is to 
provide an easy way for spam-checking messages. Currently the message is given to spamd which 
actually takes care of spam-checking the message, after completion the email is simply passed 
back to spmfilter which takes care of further processing. Activation of the module is done by 
adding spamassassin to the modules-variable within the [global]-section in spmfilter.conf like 
follows:

[global]
...
modules = spamassassin
...

Configuration for spamassassin is done by adding a new section for spamassassin to the spmfilter.conf:

[spamassassin]
host = 127.0.0.1
port = 783
quarantine_dir = /var/spool/spam
reject_spam = false
reject_msg = message identified as spam

If you're running spmfilter with spamassassin plugin as after-queue-filter and reject_spam is set to 
true, then you are going to generate bounce messages! So please make sure, you are using reject_spam 
only as pre-queue-filter.
